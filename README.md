# ClearSkyChart

This repository contains a simple web widget that fetches weather data for **Sutherland, South Africa** using the [Open-Meteo](https://open-meteo.com/) API. Because the service only provides roughly three months of historical hourly data, the widget requests the most recent 92 days and persists computed monthly averages in the browser. It displays daily metrics for the last week, 7/14/28â€‘day averages, and monthly averages for up to the last year. The widget is implemented in `widget/index.html` and can be embedded in any webpage.

## Usage

1. Open `widget/index.html` in a browser. The script requests the most recent 92 days of hourly data from the Open-Meteo API and displays three tables: daily averages for the past 7 days, overall averages for 7, 14 and 28 day periods, and monthly averages based on stored history (up to the last 12 months will be shown).
2. To embed the widget in another page, copy the file or include it with an `<iframe>`:
   ```html
   <iframe src="/path/to/widget/index.html" style="border:0;width:660px;height:600px"></iframe>
   ```

The code does not require any build step and only relies on the browser's fetch API. Internet access is required at runtime to retrieve data from Open-Meteo.

## Troubleshooting

If the widget displays **"Failed to load data"**, ensure that your network
allows connections to `api.open-meteo.com`. Some environments block external
requests, which will prevent the data from loading.
